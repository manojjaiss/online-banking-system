An Online Banking System is a web application that ensures a registered user to enjoy banking online. This Online Banking project in C is a console application without graphics.In this project, you can perform typical banking operations like depositing money, withdrawing money, checking the balance, viewing account details, and transferring money.

Here are some of the key features that this project could include:

1. **User Authentication**: The system should be able to validate registered users and grant access based on valid credentials.

2. **Account Management**: Users should be able to open new bank accounts, close existing ones, and manage their personal information.

3. **Deposit and Withdrawal**: Users should be able to deposit money into their accounts and withdraw money as needed.

4. **Balance Inquiry**: Users should be able to check the current balance of their accounts at any time.

5. **Fund Transfer**: Users should be able to transfer funds between different accounts.

6. **Transaction History**: The system should keep a history of all transactions performed by the user.

7. **Interest Calculation**: The system should automatically calculate and apply interest to accounts based on the bank's interest rate.

This project will help you understand the operations of a banking system, and the C programming concepts used in it. It's a good project to start with if you're new to programming in C. Remember to break down the project into manageable parts and tackle them one at a time. Good luck! ðŸ˜Š
